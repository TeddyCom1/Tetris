# Tetris
A python3 game that is my version of the glorious old tetris game

To play this game make sure you have python3 installed with pygame.

To install pygame:
```
pip install pygame
```

To run the game, once you're installed pygame navigate to the game folder and run the python file

```
python3 tetris.py
```
